### About Me
Hi, I’m an Electrical Engineering graduate turned Data Analyst with a passion for solving real-world problems through data. I’ve delivered insights across retail, e-commerce, HR, healthcare, and finance, using tools like Excel, SQL, Power BI, Python, and Tableau to clean data, analyze trends, build interactive dashboards, and drive data-informed decisions.
I bridge technical analysis with business needs, turning raw data into actionable insights that support growth, performance, and efficiency.  I'm passionate about solving business problems through data and am always looking to grow my analytical and storytelling skills.
